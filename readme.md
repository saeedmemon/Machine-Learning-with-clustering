# Machine-Learning-with-clustering[CSC311 A3]

## Introduction to Principle Component Analysis 
Implementing PCA from sklearn to MINST data. Created PCA from scrate to make comprison on accuracy.

## Regularization
Implementing dimensionality reduction to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy when training a classfier on data.

## Bagging 
Add on from regularization by further reduce overfitting and increase accuracy.

## Clustering 
Implemented Kmeans and Gaussian mixture model to make accuracy comparison and visualize the different clusters in a clear intutive diagram.
